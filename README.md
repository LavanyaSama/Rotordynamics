# Torsional and transverse vibrational analysis of Rotors using FEM and TMM:
## 1.The project includes matlab code for finding torsional natural frequencies and plotting mode shapes of a continuous shaft of following conditions using Finite Element Method:
i) Fixed - Free boundary condition
ii) Fixed - Fixed boundary condition
iii) Cantilever shaft with disc at free end
iv) Fixed - Fixed shaft with a disc at midspan
