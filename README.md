# Torsional vibrational analysis of Rotors using FEM and TMM:
## 1.The project includes matlab code for finding torsional natural frequencies and plotting mode shapes of a continuous shaft of following conditions using Finite Element Method:
i) Fixed - Free boundary condition                                        
ii) Fixed - Fixed boundary 
iii) Cantilever shaft with disc at free end
iv) Fixed - Fixed shaft with a disc at midspan
## 2.The project includes matlab code for finding torsional natural frequencies and plotting mode shapes of a geared system of following conditions using Transverse Matrix Method:
i) Gear system with two discs and two gears
ii) Gear system with two gears
